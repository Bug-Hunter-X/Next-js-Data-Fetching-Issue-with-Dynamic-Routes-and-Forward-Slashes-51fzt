In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getServerSideProps) or static generation (getStaticProps) with dynamic routes containing special characters, specifically forward slashes in the segments.  Consider a route like `/products/t-shirt/blue/small`.  If not handled correctly, the data fetching functions might not receive the correct parameters, leading to incorrect data or errors.
